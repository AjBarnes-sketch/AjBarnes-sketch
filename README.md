## Howdy there ðŸ¤ 
Hello, I'm Aj! I'm a backend developer passionate about learning and creating new things to help others.
I am finishing a program to hone my skills and improve my coding knowledge. I am currently learning Java code and improving my understanding of it!

A fun fact about me is I do creative writing on the side and always love to learn new skills!

-Aj
